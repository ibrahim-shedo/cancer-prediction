# Cancer Diagnosis Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a tumor is benign (B) or malignant (M) using various tumor characteristics. The model uses features such as `radius_mean`, `texture_mean`, `perimeter_mean`, `area_mean`, `smoothness_mean`, and others to predict the diagnosis (benign or malignant).

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 33 columns, each representing different characteristics of the tumor. The key columns include:

- **id**: Unique identifier for each record.
- **diagnosis**: Target variable (M = Malignant, B = Benign).
- **radius_mean**: Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter.
- **texture_mean**: Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
- **perimeter_mean**: Mean size of the tumor perimeter.
- **area_mean**: Mean area of the tumor.
- **smoothness_mean**: Local variation in radius lengths.
- **compactness_mean**: Perimeter^2 / area - 1.0.
- **concavity_mean**: Severity of concave portions of the contour.
- **concave points_mean**: Number of concave points on the tumor.
- **texture_worst**, **perimeter_worst**, **area_worst**, etc.: Worst or largest values of these characteristics.

**Note**: The `Unnamed: 32` column is irrelevant and contains NaN values, so it will be removed during preprocessing.

## Project Structure

This project contains the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Convert the `diagnosis` column to a binary format (`M = 1`, `B = 0`).
   - Drop the `id` and `Unnamed: 32` columns as they are unnecessary for modeling.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Normalize or scale the feature columns for better performance.

2. **Model Training**:
   - A logistic regression model will be trained on the dataset to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.
   
3. **Evaluation**:
   - The modelâ€™s performance will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required for running the model:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `scikit-learn`: For model building and evaluation.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
How to Run
Load the Dataset: Ensure the dataset is properly loaded into the environment.

Preprocess the Data: Clean the data by handling missing values, converting the diagnosis column, and scaling the feature columns.

Train the Model:

Split the dataset into training and test sets.
Train the logistic regression model using the training data.
Evaluate the Model:

Use the test data to evaluate the model's performance.
Make Predictions:

Input a new set of tumor characteristics to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.
Example Code
Here is a sample code to get started:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Convert diagnosis to binary (M = 1, B = 0)
data['diagnosis'] = data['diagnosis'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'M' else 0)

# Drop unnecessary columns
data = data.drop(['id', 'Unnamed: 32'], axis=1)

# Split data into features (X) and target (y)
X = data.drop('diagnosis', axis=1)
y = data['diagnosis']

# Split into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions and evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on several physical characteristics. The logistic regression model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to measure its effectiveness in diagnosing cancer.
